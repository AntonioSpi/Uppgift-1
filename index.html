 <p>I think this movie is the best Star Wars movie. It brings in the feels. The whole movie is very climatic.
    The opening scene is definitely the best opening scene in Star Wars. The character development is great, and the conclusion is just so good and a perfect transition into A New Hope.
    The final battle is the best Star Wars lightsaber fight ever. The ending is sad and bleak, it almost tear-jerking if you care for the characters and the series as much as I do.
    It is tragic and very thematic. It completely changes the way you view Star Wars. This movie hits way harder when you watch all the prequels back to back. It's a must watch for fans of Star Wars. </p>
